1. It could be a bit more concise. For example, there seems to be a lot of prompts to 
enter the name and addresses. Perhaps this can be condensed and they should ask for the
whole name and address. Instead of asking for bits of addresses at a time, they could try
to prompt for the whole address (at least the street name, number, and apartment, the 
postal code and city can be separate).

2. The value of 0 is also considered because it occupies the space of 0, it is an extra
byte of space, and stores a null character and we have to include it so it can store
26 characters.

1. The most important thing I learned is that you can use the modulus to calculate the cash register. This
would show the remainder and help create the change needed for the pennies, nickels, etc. Learning to
use the GST in the register was also useful. Identifying the different variables and knowing what each 
variable does was also critical so that there are no mix ups when debugging the code. 

2. It is used so the number will be rounded/truncated. Otherwise the number will be incorrect. This incorrect
number shows up because the amount if multiplied without the 0.005 will be rounded downwards by the compiler
and may give a different value and may not show up correctly on the register. 

3. The amount left after the mathematical operations are shown. It shows the amount of loonies needed,
and shows the remaining amount of money in decimal form. Then it goes to quarters and shows the remaining 
amount, and so on. 

4. It gives a more accurate way to present the change from the amount paid and the GST. The remainder is
supposed to be shown when for example no more loonies are needed, and it moves down to the quarters,
then dimes, nickels, and pennies. The formula also gives a truncated number so it would be better to use a
modulus operator in the code.

3. 'findContactIndex' and getTenDigitPhone are useful because they help make the code easier to read and make it work, 
particularly in the getnumbers functions. This would help because it organizes everything properly and there are less
words to write and can be easily identified without having to look through lots of code.

4. I learned that there are many function definitions that help organize the code and creates less hassle for the coder to
handle because we need a bunch of function definitions in order to help define all the extra code that is being written.
This would make everything more efficient as a result.

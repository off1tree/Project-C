The most important thing i learned from completing this workshop is the use of casting of variables to a different type. When a float type is cast to an integer type, only the whole number is stored, the rest are discarded. 
The use of adding 0.005 is to correctly round the number when a float is cast into an integer and therefore losing the float-point precision. 
Casting an operation will change the data type of the variable, discarding the data that is not stored by the new data type. 
The modulus operator is used to store what is leftover from the expression. The purpose of this workshop is to learn how to use each operator, including the modulus operator.
